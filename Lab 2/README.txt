In Lab2, I made a decagon that starts at the orgin and moves along the positive x-axis, when any of the WASD keys are pressed the shape moves in the 
corresponding direction.  When you click somewhere within the canvas the shape spawns in that spot.  Below the canvas, there are 4 buttons.  The first 
button starts the rotation of the shape, the second button stops the rotation of the shape, the third button increases the speed of which the shape moves, 
and the fourth button decreases the rate at which the shape moves.  The buttons are styled at the top of the html file using css.  When decreasing the rate
at which the shape moves, the speed will never reach zero this means that the shape will always be moving.
